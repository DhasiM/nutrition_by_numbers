# About
 As data becomes more variable, accesible and bigger, more uses are being developed for machine learning. Utilising open access datasets and information and applying machine learning is revolutionalising the world. A research team from the [Netherlands] explore the application of machine learning in predicting the status of food security. This is traditionally done by dedidcated anlysis of reported data on food security indicators.
 
 And while machine elarning still relies on this data it improves the task by being able to quickly adapt as it is given more data. As food secuorty is often as voatile as peace in many countries, the ability of ML to readily utilise new data and forcast changes in food secuirty status is beneficial to policy makers and humanitarian efort, as well as for mitigation
 
 This project attemtps to demonstrate the use of machine learning to forcast food security usng proxy indicators that represent the predictors of food security as shown in the image.

# Technologies
* Python 3
* PhpMyAdmin
* MySQL
* Apache server
* Tensorflow keras
* Scikitlearn

## Data Sources
* ## Challenges

* Finding data with the right information
* Software: Most releases are for windows and MacOS
* Dashboards are designed for time-series data and many are unable to graph data without a standard DateTime format
* Database stopped functioning and lost all the data during re-install
* Database has errors connecting to colab
* Jupyter Lab on local machine couldn't import keras models

## Lessons Learned
* Open source data is varied and unstructured
* Using relational databases reduces the work of transforming and processing data

## Model

A deep neural network with seven layers to enable it to process large amount of data. The model was trained on a subset of data representing only one country. Further work is needed to allow the model to train on multiple territories and improve it's predicitve capacity.
